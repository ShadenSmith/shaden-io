I'm a PhD candidate in computer science at the University of Minnesota. My
advisor is [George Karypis](http://glaros.dtc.umn.edu/gkhome/index.php).

I received my BS in computer science (minor in mathematics) from the University
of Kentucky in 2012. While there, I did research under [Mirek
Truszczynski](http://cs.uky.edu/~mirek/) and [Brent
Seales](http://www.stoa.org/educe/).

I have completed three internships, one most recently at Lawrence Livermore
National Laboratory where I ported
[LULESH](https://codesign.llnl.gov/lulesh.php) to OpenACC.  Before LLNL, I
spent two summers at Lexmark as the developer of a particle flow modeling
engine in CUDA.
