I'm a PhD candidate in computer science at the University of Minnesota.  I do
research under [George Karypis](http://cs.umn.edu/~karypis/), focusing on
parallel algorithms for large-scale tensor factorization.  More broadly, I'm
interested in high performance algorithms for large-scale machine learning and
data analytics. Most of my research is released part of
[SPLATT](https://github.com/ShadenSmith/splatt/), an open source software
toolkit for sparse tensor factorization.

I received my BS in computer science (minor in mathematics) from the University
of Kentucky in 2012. While there, I did research under [Mirek
Truszczynski](http://cs.uky.edu/~mirek/) and [Brent
Seales](http://www.stoa.org/educe/).

I have completed four internships, most recently at Intel Parallel Computing
Lab (PCL) where I continued my research on sparse tensor factorizations and was
also involved in hardware-software codesign. Before PCL, I spent the summer of
2013 at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) porting
[LULESH](https://codesign.llnl.gov/lulesh.php) to OpenACC.  The two summers
before LLNL (2011 and 2012), I interned at Lexmark as the developer of a
particle flow modeling engine in CUDA.
