I love pets, horror films and books, amateur homebrewing, and spicy food. My
soon-to-be wife, Sarah, and myself have two [cats](/assets/cats.jpg) and a few
[snakes](/assets/hannah.jpg) at home. Featured to the left is our first snake,
Salazar (Sal), a [carpet
python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morelia_spilota).


I started [speedcubing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speedcubing) in 2007,
which is the practice of solving a Rubik's Cube as fast as possible.  I no
longer practice competitively, but my personal tournament records can be found
[here](http://www.worldcubeassociation.org/results/p.php?i=2008SMIT01). I was
the first "Smith" to compete in an official competition.  I am a retired WCA
[delegate](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/delegates), meaning I had the
responsibility of organizing and overseeing official speedcubing competitions.
I had the privilege of staffing and competing in several national championships
and the 2013 world championships.
