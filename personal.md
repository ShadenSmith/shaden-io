My longest hobby is [speedcubing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speedcubing),
which I started in 2007. That is the practice of solving a Rubik's Cube as
fast as possible. My personal tournament records can be found
[here](http://www.worldcubeassociation.org/results/p.php?i=2008SMIT01). I was
the first 'Smith' to compete in an official competition.

I no longer practice competitively, but do stay active in the speedcubing
community. I am a retired WCA
[delegate](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/delegates). Delegates have the
responsibility of organizing and overseeing official speedcubing competitions.
I had the privilege of staffing and competing in several national championships
and the 2013 world championships.
