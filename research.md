My interests span high performance computing, with my thesis focusing on sparse
tensor factorization. I am the developer of
[SPLATT](https://github.com/ShadenSmith/splatt), a parallel toolkit for
sparse tensor factorization and related routines.

Beyond tensor factorization, I am interested in:
  * Computational linear algebra
  * Hardware accelerators (GPUs, MICs, etc.)
  * Fault-tolerant algorithms
  * Parallel programming models
