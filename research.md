My research is primarily concerned with the development of scalable, high
performance algorithms for applications in data mining and machine learning.
*Irregular* applications are of particular interest to me, such as those
that operate on sparse graphs, matrices, and tensors.

My thesis work has focused on large-scale sparse tensor factorization and is
culminated in [SPLATT](https://github.com/ShadenSmith/splatt) , an open source
software toolkit for tensor factorization and related kernels. SPLATT has been
scaled to over 16,000 cores and is actively used by academic, industry, and
government researchers.
