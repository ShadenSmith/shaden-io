My interests span high performance computing, specifically in applications
related to data mining and machine learning.  My ongoing thesis focuses on
sparse tensor factorization. I am the developer of
[SPLATT](https://github.com/ShadenSmith/splatt), a parallel toolkit for sparse
tensor factorization and related routines.

Beyond tensor factorization, I am interested in:
  * Computational linear algebra
  * Parallel algorithms for graph analytics
  * Hardware accelerators (GPUs, MICs, etc.)
  * Parallel programming models
